<a href="http://devrintalen.net/about/me/" rel="attachment wp-att-126"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-126" alt="Devrin Talen" src="http://devrintalen.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/me.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" height="683" /></a>I'm Devrin Talen and I validate server processors (post-silicon, uphill both ways). In my spare time I tinker with a worn STK500, write posts for this blog, and enjoy life in Boston with my wonderful wife and our little furball of a dog.

I love to hear from everyone! If you have an idea for a project you want to work on together, have a request for a post, or just want to say hi, then shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:dct23@cornell.edu">dct23@cornell.edu</a>. You can also get a copy of <a href="http://devrintalen.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/devrintalen.pdf">my resume</a>.
