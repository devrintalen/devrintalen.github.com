    <h1>ADBUSB</h1>
    <p>This is a board that converts Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) to USB,
    allowing you to use your favorite old Apple Extended
    Keyboard. After picking up a pair of old keyboards at the MIT flea
    market I knew that I had to do something about them. I did the
    sensible engineer thing and refuse to spend money to make my life
    easier, so I started hacking with my STK-500 and my (at the time)
    favorite HP 1631D logic analyzer, and within a bit I had a grasp
    of the protocol and what it would take to implement it. This is
    still a work in progress, and you can always find the latest on
    the <a href="https://github.com/devrintalen/adbusb">Github ADBUSB
    project page</a>.</p>

    <h1>USB2.0 Host Controller</h1>
    <p>This one was a total blast. I worked with Chris Leary and Ben
      Hutton and we managed to code a USB 2.0 host controller entirely
      in software on an Atmel Mega32. I've never had to cram more
      engineer datasheet jargon than then, and it's never been as
      challenging as that. We spent a month of long hours trying to
      get a mouse to work with our board, running into all sorts of
      problems (most of which were solved with ever-increasing amounts
      of caffeine). Chris and I took on the project again the next
      semester as an independent study and cleaned up the project. You
      can view our project pages for

    <h1>Mobile Desk Chair Project</h1>
    <p>Back in high school my dad got me my first microcontroller: the
    BASIC Stamp. After getting through the basic projects I wanted
    something more challenging. A family friend donated an old
    electric wheelchair and I started hacking away. It wasn't long
    until I had an accelerometer attached to a glove that I used to
    control the speed and direction of the chair. I ended up using
    that as my desk chair for the rest of high school. I've never
    asked, but I think my parents probably had to take out a special
    insurance policy for that... Sadly, the original blog is no longer
    hosted, but Parallax has
