It's arrived - my first printed board for ADBUSB (and only my second PCB ever). I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, and no complaints at all about the quality - BatchPCB continues to impress me.

A few thoughts:
<ul>
	<li>The vias all have a silkscreen outline. Not sure why pcb decided to put that in. I should have caught that when looking at the gerbers.</li>
	<li>I put the minidin connector backwards on the board. I have no words for how dumb this was. I think this revision is pretty much dead in the water unless I can mount it upside down and have the same traces work, or I'll need to cut the lines and play around with them a bit. Live and learn!</li>
	<li>I had no idea just how tiny 0603 components are. I've seen balls of solder bigger than these.</li>
</ul>
Update: I used the wrong footprint for the Mega32. There's no salvaging this design, so it's back to the drawing board for now. Oh well.
